"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks


Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are more red blocks than yellow blocks on the table. All of the blocks on the edges of the table are yellow.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are many red blocks on the left side of the table, and there is at most one stack of yellow blocks on the right side.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale.

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks


Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are more red blocks than yellow blocks on the table. All of the blocks on the edges of the table are yellow.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 6 Very likely more yellow blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow

In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following:

There is one stack of yellow blocks on the left side of the table, and there are two stacks of red blocks on the middle.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are many red blocks on the left side of the table, and there is at most one stack of yellow blocks on the right side.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 6 Very likely more yellow blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are three stacks of red blocks, and there are two stacks of yellow blocks. There are no tall red stacks, and there are no short yellow stacks.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are tall stacks of red blocks, and there are short stacks of yellow blocks.If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?
Answer: 4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. There are at least five stacks of blocks on the table. No more than half of the stacks are tall. Most of the stacks are red, and most of the stacks are on the right side.

"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each scenario, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks
