"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow. The blocks may be in stacks. In each situation, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. 
There are four stacks of red blocks, and there is one stack of yellow blocks.
If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?",Answer: 1 Definitely more red blocks,-7.851098169999999,0.4129741342240675

In each situation, you will be asked to imagine the table based on the description, and then imagine that the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor. Your task will be to think about whether, after the bump, there will be more red or yellow blocks on the floor. You will answer each question based on a 7-point multiple choice scale. Your answer to each question should be one of the following: 
1 Definitely more red blocks
2 Very likely more red blocks
3 Somewhat likely more red blocks
4 Equally likely more red or more yellow
5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks
6 Very likely more yellow blocks
7 Definitely more yellow blocks
Scenario: Imagine there is a table. 
There are at least five stacks of blocks on the table. No more than half of the stacks are tall. Most of the stacks are red, and most of the stacks are on the right side.
If the table is bumped hard enough to knock at least one of the blocks onto the floor, are there going to be more red blocks or yellow blocks on the floor?",Answer: 5 Somewhat likely more yellow blocks,-9.84653963144,0.10998814816425541
"In this experiment, you will be reading a series of simple descriptions about a table with some blocks on it. The blocks are cubes, and the blocks are always either red or yellow.
